This directory is the repo-local directive for CET's agentic development. It is generated from the Shepherd checkout and should guide Vibe-Coding agents toward a consistent target architecture.

## Purpose

CET is expected to become a self-aligning Stadtwerk/Energiversorger assistant: first use should help configure tenant/context/process boundaries in the background, while humans get a safe, evidence-aware assistant.

## Operating rule for coding agents

When changing chat, OpenWebUI, routing, capabilities, evidence, HITL, tools, services, or OpenAPI exposure, update or satisfy the canon in this directory. New fachliche behavior should be visible as a capability with evidence and process-state boundaries, not only as a service/action name.
