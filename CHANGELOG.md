# Changelog

All notable changes to the Cernion Energy Tools project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **CSV Export** - All asset endpoints now support CSV download format
  - Add `format=csv` query parameter to any `/api/assets/*` endpoint
  - Automatically sets proper response headers (`Content-Type: text/csv`, `Content-Disposition: attachment`)
  - CSV includes all fields including new operational status fields
  - Works with all filters (location, operationalStatus, minCapacityKW, etc.)
  - Available for all endpoints: list, solar, wind, storage, biomass, hydro, combustion, all

- **Operational Status Filtering** - Smart filtering by installation operational status
  - **Default behavior**: Only returns active installations (status 35 - "In Betrieb")
  - Override with `operationalStatus` parameter: `35` (active), `38` (decommissioned), `all`, or comma-separated
  - Reduces noise in results - most users only need active installations
  - Status codes: 31=Planned, 35=In operation, 37=Temporarily decommissioned, 38=Permanently decommissioned
  - Applies to all asset endpoints

- **Status Fields in Output** - Installation operational status now visible in API responses
  - `Betriebsstatus`: Status code (e.g., "35")
  - `Betriebsstatus Name`: German status name (e.g., "In Betrieb")
  - Allows users to verify filter behavior and understand installation state
  - Included in both JSON and CSV output formats

- **Cernion Token as Request Parameter** - Flexible authentication options
  - Pass Cernion MCP token as query parameter: `?token=YOUR_TOKEN`
  - Alternative to Bearer token header authentication
  - Overrides `CERNION_TOKEN` environment variable for the request
  - Enables easy browser testing and multi-tenant scenarios
  - Documented in OpenAPI specification

### Changed
- **Breaking**: Default behavior change for asset endpoints
  - Now returns only active installations (status 35) by default
  - Previous behavior (all statuses): Use `operationalStatus=all`
  - Rationale: Most users only need active installations; decommissioned units create noise
  - Easy to override for users who need all installations

### Technical Details
- CSV conversion with proper escaping and UTF-8 encoding
- Client-side operational status filtering after MCP tool call with stats recalculation
- Field mapping includes status extraction from `einheitBetriebsstatus` with German name mapping
- OpenAPI documentation fully updated with new parameters and response formats
- Response header manipulation for CSV download behavior

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed
- **Assets Service** - Location parameter now correctly passed to MCP tool for postal code filtering
- **Assets Service** - Fixed validation error when using gridOperatorId without location parameter
- **Energy Market Service** - Added postleitzahl parameter support for precise location filtering
- Parameter handling: postleitzahl only set when location is actually provided (prevents validation errors)

### Technical Details
- Bug 1: energy-market.service.js was accepting location parameter but not forwarding it to MCP tool
- Bug 2: assets.service.js was always setting postleitzahl even when undefined, causing validation failure
- Both fixes apply to all asset types (solar, wind, storage, biomass, hydro, combustion)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **Assets Service** - Complete grid operator asset management service
  - Retrieve all installations from German Marktstammdatenregister (MaStR) for a distribution network operator
  - Support for all installation types: solar, wind, storage, biomass, hydro, combustion
  - VNB filtering by BDEW code, MaStR grid operator ID, or operator name
  - Redispatch 2.0 filter (installations ≥100kW)
  - No pagination required - can retrieve millions of installations
  - Type-specific endpoints: `/api/assets/solar`, `/api/assets/wind`, `/api/assets/storage`, etc.
  - Combined endpoint: `/api/assets/all` with optional type selection
- VNB/DSO lookup endpoints for grid operator discovery
- BDEW → MaStR grid operator ID resolution
- MaStR installation filters for grid operator identification

### Changed
- Moved assets service from custom-services to core services directory
- OpenAPI documentation fully translated to English for international compatibility
- Expanded OpenAPI documentation with detailed descriptions, examples, and error responses
- Grid operator analysis/export accepts BDEW/MaStR identifiers in addition to names

### Fixed
- VNB filtering now works for all installation types (solar, wind, storage, biomass, combustion)
- Removed workaround code that restricted VNB filtering to storage-only after MaStR database update

### Testing
- Added comprehensive test coverage for assets service
- Integration tests for VNB filtering across all installation types

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- Custom service and test directories for local extensions (custom-services/, custom-tests/)
- Creator CLI support for iterative updates, catalog-aware generation, and optional live MCP integration tests
- Test helper script for custom services (`npm run test:custom`)
- Hot reload and runtime loading for both core and custom services

### Changed
- Service creator now resolves Gemini model availability and falls back to supported models
- Creator and runtime guidance updated for OpenAPI coverage and ctx.call orchestration

### Fixed
- Normalized CO₂ intensity forecast response shape to align with MCP tool data
- Improved resilience when mapping forecast arrays from MCP responses
