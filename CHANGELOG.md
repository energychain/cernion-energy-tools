## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **Assets Service** - Complete grid operator asset management service
  - Retrieve all installations from German Marktstammdatenregister (MaStR) for a distribution network operator
  - Support for all installation types: solar, wind, storage, biomass, hydro, combustion
  - VNB filtering by BDEW code, MaStR grid operator ID, or operator name
  - Redispatch 2.0 filter (installations ≥100kW)
  - No pagination required - can retrieve millions of installations
  - Type-specific endpoints: `/api/assets/solar`, `/api/assets/wind`, `/api/assets/storage`, etc.
  - Combined endpoint: `/api/assets/all` with optional type selection
- VNB/DSO lookup endpoints for grid operator discovery
- BDEW → MaStR grid operator ID resolution
- MaStR installation filters for grid operator identification

### Changed
- Moved assets service from custom-services to core services directory
- OpenAPI documentation fully translated to English for international compatibility
- Expanded OpenAPI documentation with detailed descriptions, examples, and error responses
- Grid operator analysis/export accepts BDEW/MaStR identifiers in addition to names

### Fixed
- VNB filtering now works for all installation types (solar, wind, storage, biomass, combustion)
- Removed workaround code that restricted VNB filtering to storage-only after MaStR database update

### Testing
- Added comprehensive test coverage for assets service
- Integration tests for VNB filtering across all installation types

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- Custom service and test directories for local extensions (custom-services/, custom-tests/)
- Creator CLI support for iterative updates, catalog-aware generation, and optional live MCP integration tests
- Test helper script for custom services (`npm run test:custom`)
- Hot reload and runtime loading for both core and custom services

### Changed
- Service creator now resolves Gemini model availability and falls back to supported models
- Creator and runtime guidance updated for OpenAPI coverage and ctx.call orchestration

### Fixed
- Normalized CO₂ intensity forecast response shape to align with MCP tool data
- Improved resilience when mapping forecast arrays from MCP responses

## Release Notes

### v0.1.0 - Initial Release

This is the first public release of Cernion Energy Tools, providing a comprehensive microservices platform for energy market data analysis and operations. The system integrates with multiple data sources including:

- **MaStR** (Marktstammdatenregister) - German registry of energy installations
- **ENTSO-E** Transparency Platform - European electricity grid data
- **SMARD.de** - German electricity market data
- **AGSI** - European gas storage data
- **Netztransparenz.de** - German grid operator data
- **GrünstromIndex** - Regional CO₂ intensity forecasts

The platform supports both direct API queries and natural language queries powered by AI, making energy data accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

### Key Features in v0.1.0

1. **REST API First**: All functionality exposed via REST endpoints
2. **OpenAPI Documentation**: Auto-generated Swagger documentation
3. **Bearer Token Auth**: Support for Cernion MCP tokens
4. **Async Jobs**: Long-running queries return job IDs for polling
5. **Multi-Format Dates**: ISO 8601, YYYYMMDD, German format (DD.MM.YYYY)
6. **Comprehensive Statistics**: Most endpoints include statistical summaries
7. **EIC Code Resolution**: Automatic European energy code resolution
8. **Template Learning**: Self-learning query system for 20x faster repeated queries
